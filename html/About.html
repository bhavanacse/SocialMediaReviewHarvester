	            <p style="text-align: justify;">
	               This project was proposed as a San Francisco State University(SFSU) Computer Science Department Graduate student project, under the supervision of Professor Dragutin Petkovic, Professor M. Murphy(retired in April 2014), and Professor Hui Yang. It is to design a Web Application to display collaborated user reviews coming from various social-media sites like Yelp, Trip Advisor, Twitter, etc on a certain topic. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  This web application are for the users to view collective user reviews that are stored in uniform structured database. It has criteria to select websites, topics, tenure and date range for the user to view reviews and graphs basing on it. Graphs are interactive in order to view user reviews basing on the position of clicks. These graphs are on total reviews and average ratings of reviews for topics across different social-media sites. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  Trends charts basing on total reviews and average ratings are shown with drill down feature providing a view of graphs related to a single topic across websites which can be further drilled down to years, months and days. These charts can be printed and exported to different formats like PNG, JPEG, PDF and SVEG. This application and database are hosted by a cloud environment, Amazon Web Services(AWS). The design of the database schema and leveraging of cloud service is a collaborative effort with fellow student Mayyin O'Neill.
